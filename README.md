# Spotify Clone Pet Project

## :pencil: About the project

This is a small sized front-end pet project where I challenged myself to clone desktop view of Spotify at playing a music state. I successfully completed developing the main layout and reused components. I styled the main layout and almost all other components using only Tailwind.css.
